## Hi there 👋

🚀 I am an aspiring Data Analyst with a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for leveraging data to drive impactful business decisions. I am a Master's student in Computer Science from Oklahoma State University, where I gained extensive experience in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. My diverse project experience spans the tech, finance, and business sectors, allowing me to develop a versatile skill set 🚀

❇️ Proficient in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools such as Power BI, Tableau, and Microsoft Excel. Skilled in Python libraries (Pandas) and Machine Learning frameworks (TensorFlow) for predictive modeling and data analysis. Experienced in ETL, KPI, and data modeling, with a strong focus on enhancing business intelligence capabilities.

❇️ I worked as a Project Engineer At Wipro Technologies for 2 years, I successfully conducted Root Cause Analysis and defect resolution for MasterCard projects in the banking and finance domain. I utilized SQL and advanced Excel functions like Power Query, XLOOKUP, VLOOKUP, and Pivot Tables to analyze data and create detailed error analysis reports. These efforts improved system integrity and reduced downtime, resulting in a 30% increase in operational efficiency.
 
❇️ As a Graduate Research Assistant, I contributed to the Intelligence Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC), where I developed an advanced traffic sign detection system using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) integrated with YOLOv5 and ROS. My work on the graphical user interface (GUI) enabled accurate detection of stop signs with 95% accuracy and successfully identified fake stop signs. Also worked on a tweet classification project machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques to categorize unstructured data into smart city service dimensions, achieving over 90% accuracy and providing valuable insights for urban planning.

❇️ Published a research paper on AI and Machine Learning applications in Springer. My research focused on developing an intelligent chatbot application (U-bot) for the Unique Identification Authority of India. 

❇️ Demonstrated mentorship skills as a GTA in Software Engineering & Engineering Analysis and Mathematics, effectively facilitating learning for over 60 students. I provided support to students in SQL, SDLC, Statistics, Calculus, Algebra, and Probability for two semesters.
